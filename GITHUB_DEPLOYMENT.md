# GitHub Deployment Instructions for QuickBasket Mobile App

Since the GitHub repository doesn't exist yet, you'll need to create it and upload your mobile app. Here are the complete steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Name it: `quickbasket-pwa`
4. Make it public or private (your choice)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

Run these commands in your terminal from the project directory:

```powershell
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Ragnarok1296/quickbasket-pwa.git

# Push your code and tags
git push -u origin master
git push origin --tags
```

## Step 3: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Releases" in the right sidebar
3. Click "Create a new release"
4. Choose tag: `v0.0.1` (should be available from Step 2)
5. Release title: `QuickBasket Mobile App v0.0.1`
6. Description:
   ```
   Initial release of the QuickBasket Mobile App
   
   **Features:**
   - Add recipes manually or from URLs
   - Manage grocery lists
   - Browse saved recipes
   - PWA companion integration
   
   **Downloads:**
   - Android Release APK (recommended for users)
   - Android Debug APK (for developers)
   ```

7. Upload the following files as release assets:
   - `releases/QuickBasket-Mobile-v0.0.1-release.apk`
   - `releases/QuickBasket-Mobile-v0.0.1-debug.apk`

8. Check "This is a pre-release" if this is a beta version
9. Click "Publish release"

## Step 4: Alternative - Direct File Upload

If you prefer not to use releases, you can also:

1. Create a `downloads` branch:
   ```powershell
   git checkout -b downloads
   git push origin downloads
   ```

2. Users can then download the APK files directly from the `releases/` folder in your repository

## File Locations

Your APK files are ready for deployment at:
- **Release APK**: `releases/QuickBasket-Mobile-v0.0.1-release.apk` (46.8 MB)
- **Debug APK**: `releases/QuickBasket-Mobile-v0.0.1-debug.apk` (99.1 MB)

## Next Steps

After deployment, consider:
- Adding installation instructions to your main README.md
- Setting up automated builds with GitHub Actions
- Creating a simple landing page for downloads

Your mobile app is now ready to be deployed to GitHub! ðŸš€
