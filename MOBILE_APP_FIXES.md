# üîß QuickBasket Mobile App Crash Fixes

## üö® Main Issues Fixed

### 1. **Network Configuration Problem**
**Issue**: App was trying to connect to `localhost:5000` which doesn't work on Android devices.

**Fix**: Updated `src/services/apiService.ts`:
- Changed `localhost:5000` to `10.0.2.2:5000` (Android emulator)
- Added better error handling to prevent crashes when backend is unavailable

### 2. **Unhandled Network Errors** 
**Issue**: API failures were throwing unhandled exceptions causing crashes.

**Fix**: 
- Added try-catch blocks with graceful fallbacks
- Return empty arrays instead of throwing errors
- Show user-friendly error messages

### 3. **Android Network Security**
**Issue**: Android blocks HTTP connections by default on newer versions.

**Fix**: Updated `AndroidManifest.xml` and added `network_security_config.xml`:
- Allow cleartext traffic for development
- Added network state permission
- Configured security policy for local development

### 4. **Missing Error Boundaries**
**Issue**: JavaScript errors would crash the entire app.

**Fix**: Added `ErrorBoundary` component:
- Catches and displays user-friendly error messages
- Provides "Try Again" functionality
- Prevents complete app crashes

## üõ†Ô∏è Files Modified

1. **`src/services/apiService.ts`** - Fixed network configuration and error handling
2. **`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`** - Updated permissions and security
3. **`android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`** - New file for network security
4. **`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`** - New crash prevention component
5. **`App.tsx`** - Added error boundary wrapper

## üì± Testing the Fixed App

### For Development Testing:
1. **Start Backend**: Make sure your Flask server is running on your computer
2. **Find Your IP**: Run `ipconfig` and note your IPv4 address
3. **Update API URL**: If needed, change `10.0.2.2:5000` to `YOUR_IP:5000` in `apiService.ts`

### For Production Use:
The app now gracefully handles network errors and will:
- Show empty lists instead of crashing
- Display helpful error messages
- Allow users to retry failed operations
- Work offline (with limited functionality)

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### App Still Crashing?

1. **Check Logs**: Use `adb logcat` to see detailed crash logs
2. **Network Issues**: Verify backend is accessible from your device
3. **Permissions**: Ensure all required permissions are granted
4. **Storage**: Make sure device has enough free space

### Backend Connection Issues:

1. **For Physical Device**: Use your computer's actual IP address instead of `10.0.2.2`
2. **For Emulator**: Use `10.0.2.2:5000`
3. **For Production**: Replace with your deployed backend URL

### Building Issues:

```powershell
# Clean and rebuild
cd QuickBasketMobile
./android/gradlew.bat -p android clean
./android/gradlew.bat -p android assembleRelease
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Test the New APK**: Install the newly built version
2. **Monitor Logs**: Check for any remaining issues
3. **Deploy Backend**: Consider deploying your Flask app to a cloud service
4. **Add Offline Support**: Consider implementing local storage for offline functionality

The fixed app should now be much more stable and handle errors gracefully!
